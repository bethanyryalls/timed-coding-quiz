# Timed Javascript Quiz

## Description
A quiz app that runs in the browser and is powered by HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. While timed, a user answers questions on JavaScript fundamentals. If they answer a question wrong, the timer goes down by 10 seconds. Once they have answered all the questions or the timer hits 0, they are able to add their initials to save their score and view a list of the highscores.

The criteria for this project:

1. User able to click the 'Start Quiz' button and is presented with the first question
2. A timer starts and counts down in seconds
3. When the user answers a question wrong, the timer goes down by 10 seconds
4. When all questions are answered, or the timer hits 0 the game is over
5. The user then saves their initials with their score
6. The list of saved scores and initials are presented in a 'highscore' list
